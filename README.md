aaa
The L game is a simple abstract strategy board game invented by Edward de Bono. The L game is a two-player game played on a board of 4×4 squares. Each player has a 3×2 L-shaped piece, and there are two 1×1 neutral pieces. The game is won by leaving the opponent unable to move their L piece to a new position.
